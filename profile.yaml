about: |
  I lead teams at the intersection of technology, intelligence, and mission delivery. My focus is on building scalable systems that give governments, defence organisations, and industry the ability to see and act with precision.

  I’ve worked across New Zealand and Europe in roles spanning AI, analytics, geospatial intelligence, and enterprise technology — from leading product and technology portfolios to shaping national data strategies.

  I combine a background in applied mathematics and law with experience leading engineering, product, and research teams. My approach is pragmatic: design for clarity, build for resilience, and measure impact through outcomes, not outputs.
